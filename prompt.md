Create a text-based zombie survival game called DeadText for Telegram using Python, where players start with health, food, water, and weapons. The game is interactive, with each new game presenting a unique scenario generated by openrouter. Players make decisions to survive a zombie apocalypse, facing random events and challenges.

Core Mechanics:

Player Resources: Health, food, water, weapons.
Actions: Search for supplies, fight zombies, rest to regain health, move to different locations.
Consequences: Consuming resources, losing health, finding new items.
Random Events: Zombie attacks, hidden supply caches, encounters with other survivors.
Win/Lose Conditions: Win by surviving a set number of days or reaching a safe zone; lose by health depletion or resource exhaustion.

State Management:

Use a dictionary to track player data, with chat IDs as keys. For persistent data storage use sqlite.

Narrative and Immersion:
Provide descriptive text for actions and events to enhance player engagement.
Balance challenges to be tough but fair, with meaningful player choices.
Allow player to select difficulty levels, play around with the resources/fewer zombies/slower resource depletion etc

Implementation Steps:
Use the python-telegram-bot library to handle messages and commands.
Implement game state management using a dictionary.
Integrate AI-generated scenarios for unique game experiences.


Final Notes:
Aim for a user-friendly interface with clear feedback after each action.
